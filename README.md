# Artificial Intelligence Research Papers 📝
This is a list of AI papers 📝 I have read. Now it's your turn! 🤘 Happy reading 📖

### Deep Learning
This sub-field of AI is concerned with wide (maybe) and deep (most of the time) neural networks based computational approach to intelligence in machines.

#### Generative Models
- FaceGANs: Stable Generative Adversarial Networks with High-Quality Images [[ICLR 2018 Workshop](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJn_vKyPM)]

#### White Papers
- TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning [[arXIv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08695)][[official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)]
